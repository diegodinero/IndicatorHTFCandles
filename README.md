Higher Timeframe Overlay with FVG & Volume Imbalance
This indicator overlays a user-selected higher timeframe directly onto the current chart, allowing traders to visualize broader market structure without switching timeframes. It also detects and plots Fair Value Gaps (FVG) and Volume Imbalance zones from the higher timeframe, making it easier to spot institutional price inefficiencies and key liquidity areas in real time. Perfect for multi-timeframe analysis and precision trade planning.

## Positioning Features

The indicator includes flexible positioning options to prevent obstruction of the main chart:

- **Horizontal Offset**: Adjust the horizontal position of HTF candles relative to the current price bars
- **Vertical Offset**: Move HTF candles up or down on the chart to avoid overlapping with the price scale and current candles. This allows you to position the HTF candles anywhere vertically on your chart for optimal viewing
- **Indicator Spacing**: Control the spacing between the current chart candles and the HTF candles

Users can now scroll and view HTF candles at any position on the chart without interfering with current candles or the price scale, improving overall chart readability and usability.
