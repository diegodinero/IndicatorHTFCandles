Higher Timeframe Overlay with FVG & Volume Imbalance
This indicator overlays a user-selected higher timeframe directly onto the current chart, allowing traders to visualize broader market structure without switching timeframes. It also detects and plots Fair Value Gaps (FVG) and Volume Imbalance zones from the higher timeframe, making it easier to spot institutional price inefficiencies and key liquidity areas in real time. Perfect for multi-timeframe analysis and precision trade planning.
